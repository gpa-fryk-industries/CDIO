# CDIO

## Hardware
Altium project and libraries are located in `hw/`. Schematics are available as PDF in `hw/board/`.

## Firmware
The firmware is split up in two. The MCU in `fw/mcu` and the FPGA in `fw/ice`. The README in `fw/` explains the 
configuration routine used for the FPGA.

See `fw/mcu/README-md` for instruction on how to compile the MCU firmware and dependencies.
